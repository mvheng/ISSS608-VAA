# **Setting the Scene**

OECD education director Andreas Schleicher shared in a BBC article that “Singapore managed to achieve excellence without wide differences between children from wealthy and disadvantaged families.” (2016) Furthermore, several Ministers for Education from Singapore also started an “every school a good school” slogan. However, the general public strongly believes that there are disparities, especially between elite schools and neighborhood schools, between students from families with higher socioeconomic status and those with relatively lower socioeconomic status, and between immigrant and non-immigrant families.

# **The Task**

The 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data was released on December 5, 2022. PISA global education survey every three years to assess the education systems worldwide by testing 15-year-old students in Mathematics, Reading, and Science.

![](/images/PISA2022.jpg){fig-align="center" width="208"}

We are tasked to use appropriate **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** methods and **ggplot2** functions to reveal:

-   the distribution of Singapore students’ performance in mathematics, reading, and science, and

-   the relationships between these performances with schools, gender, and socioeconomic status of these students.

# 1. Data Preparation

## 1.1 Installing R packages

The code below uses p_load() of the Pacman package to check if all the required packages are installed on the laptop. If they are, then they will be launched into the R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, dplyr, ggthemes, patchwork,
               ggdist, plyr, ggpubr, ggridges, colorspace, reshape2)
```

## 1.2 Importing PISA data

The code chunk below uses [read_sas()](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) of [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) to import PISA data into the R environment. Note that the code in this segment has the evaluation flag set to FALSE as the data file is big and we do not use it to reload this data again.

```{r}
#| eval: false
stu_qqq <- read_sas("data/cy08msp_stu_qqq.sas7bdat")
```

As our task is focused on Singapore students, let's filter the data by CNT = SGP. The data is then saved into another RDS file for easy loading of Singapore data later.

```{r}
#| eval: false
stu_qqq_SG <- stu_qqq %>%
  filter(CNT == "SGP")
write_rds(stu_qqq_SG, "data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
```

## 1.3 Summary Statistics of Singapore PISA data

Let's read the SG data and do some explorations

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG <- read_rds("data/stu_qqq_SG.rds")
head(stu_qqq_SG, 5)
```

```{r}
n_distinct(stu_qqq_SG$CNTSCHID)
```

::: textclass
What we know about the data:

-   There are 1279 columns with 6606 records.

-   Students are randomly picked from all 149 secondary schools and 15 private schools (total 164)

-   There are 10 plausible values for each subject (Maths, Reading, Science)

-   Students are classified into 3 immigrant statuses: Native, 1st generation and 2nd generation

-   Economic, Social and cultural status (ESCS) is calculated based on 3 indicators (highest parental occupation status, HISEI, highest education of parents in years, PAREDINT, and home possessions, HOMEPOS)
:::

# 2. Data Wrangling

## 2.1 Changing data types of some columns

Some of the data types are not correct. For example, immigrant status (IMMIG), gender (ST004D01T), school ID (CNTSCHID), and highest parent education in years (PAREDINT) should be categorical instead of numerical.

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG$IMMIG[stu_qqq_SG$IMMIG == 1] <- "Native"
stu_qqq_SG$IMMIG[stu_qqq_SG$IMMIG == 2] <- "1stGen"
stu_qqq_SG$IMMIG[stu_qqq_SG$IMMIG == 3] <- "2ndGen"

stu_qqq_SG$ST004D01T[stu_qqq_SG$ST004D01T == 1] <- "Female"
stu_qqq_SG$ST004D01T[stu_qqq_SG$ST004D01T == 2] <- "Male"

stu_qqq_SG$CNTSCHID <- as.factor(stu_qqq_SG$CNTSCHID)

stu_qqq_SG$PAREDINT <- as.factor(stu_qqq_SG$PAREDINT)
```

## 2.2 Average scores of each subject

Let's calculate the average of all ten plausible values of each subject and store them in the dataset.

```{r}
stu_qqq_SG <- stu_qqq_SG %>%
  mutate(Maths = 
           rowSums(stu_qqq_SG[paste0('PV', c(1:10), "MATH")], 
                   na.rm = TRUE)/10) %>% 
  mutate(Reading = 
           rowSums(stu_qqq_SG[paste0('PV', c(1:10), "READ")], 
                   na.rm = TRUE)/10) %>% 
  mutate(Science = 
           rowSums(stu_qqq_SG[paste0('PV', c(1:10), "SCIE")], 
                   na.rm = TRUE)/10)
```

Let's take a look at the spread of each subject's scores:

```{r}
# Melt the data first
temp_Data <- stu_qqq_SG[, c("Maths", "Science", "Reading")]
temp_Data <- melt(temp_Data, variable.name = "Subject")
ggplot(temp_Data, aes(x = value, y = Subject)) +
  stat_halfeye(aes(fill = Subject), 
               adjust = 0.5,
               justification = 0.1,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 16, 
               size = 3, color = "darkred", 
               position = position_nudge(x = 0.0)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, colour="darkred", 
               geom = "text", show_guide = FALSE, 
               vjust = -0.7, aes( label=round(after_stat(x), 1))) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "scores",
       title = "Distribution of scores",
       subtitle = "Students tend to do better in Maths as compared to Reading and Science") +
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

::: callout-tip
## Observation

Students did better in Maths, followed by Science and then Reading.
:::

## 2.3 Immigrant vs non-immigrant students

Let's take a look at the proportion of immigrant (1st Generation and 2nd Generation) vs non-immigrant (native) students. Rows with 'NA' responses for immigrant status are removed in this plot.

```{r}
stu_immigrant <- stu_qqq_SG %>% drop_na(IMMIG)

ggplot(data = stu_immigrant, aes(x= IMMIG, fill = IMMIG)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightgreen", "orange", "lightblue")) +
  geom_bar() + 
  ylim(0, 4700) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(after_stat(count), ", ", 
      round(after_stat(count)/sum(after_stat(count))*100, 1), "%")), 
      stat = "count", vjust = -0.5, colour = "brown") +
  labs(x = "Immigrant status",
       title = "Distribution of immigrant statuses",
       subtitle = "72% of the students are native")

```

::: callout-tip
## Observation

The majority of the students are native whereas about 27% of the students are 1st or 2nd generation immigrants.
:::

## 2.4 Gender distribution

Let's find out the proportion of female vs male students.

```{r}
percentage_data <- as.data.frame(table(stu_qqq_SG$ST004D01T))
colnames(percentage_data)[1] <- "Gender"
percentage_data <- percentage_data %>%
  mutate(percentage =  Freq / sum(Freq) * 100)

ggplot(percentage_data, aes(x = "", y = Freq, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#66c2a5", "#fc8d62")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(sprintf("%.1f", percentage), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Gender distribution")

```

::: callout-tip
## Observation

The proportion of male and female students are quite similar, with male having slightly over 50%.
:::

## 2.5 Socioeconomic distribution

PISA index of economic, social and cultural status (ESCS) is used to distinguish between socio-economically disadvantaged students and socio-economically advantaged students. Socio-economic status is thus a measure of students’ access to family resources (financial capital, social capital, cultural capital and human capital) and the social position of the student’s family/household.

```{r}
ggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = ESCS)) +
  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0, point_colour = NA) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.20,
               outlier.shape = NA) +
  labs(y = NULL,
       title = "Distribution of socio-economic index") +
  theme_economist()
```

```{r}
ggplot(stu_immigrant, aes(x = IMMIG, y = ESCS)) +
  stat_halfeye(aes(fill = IMMIG), adjust = 0.5,
               justification = 0.1,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("pink", "lightgreen", "lightblue")) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_economist()+
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 16, 
               size = 3, color = "darkred", 
               position = position_nudge(x = 0.0)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, colour="darkred", 
               geom = "text", show_guide = FALSE, 
               vjust = -0.7, aes( label=round(after_stat(y), 1))) +
  labs(x =NULL,
       title = "Distribution of ESCS by immigrant status",
       subtitle = "Non-native students tends to have a higher ESCS index") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

::: callout-tip
## Observations

-   On average, the ESCS index for Singaporean students is above 0.

-   ESCS index is slighty higher for non-native students as compared to the natives.

## 3.2 Correlation between anxiety in Maths and Maths performance

Research has shown that anxiety in students affects their performances in examinations or tests, especially in Maths. Let's plot a scatter chart to visualise this relationship.

```{r}

ggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG, aes(x = Maths, y = ANXMAT)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, linewidth = 0.5) +
  stat_cor(label.x.npc="left", hjust = 0.1, 
           p.accuracy = 0.001, r.accuracy = 0.01, color = "brown") +
  theme_economist() +
  labs(y = "Math Anxiety Index",
       title = "Anxiety index vs Math scores",
       subtitle = "Students with high anxiety index tend to do poorer in Maths")
```

::: callout-tip
## Observation

From the scatter plot above, we can see that there is a slight negative correlation (r = -0.31) between the anxiety index and Maths scores. This means that students with anxiety (index \> 0) tend to do poorer in Maths.
:::

## 3.3 Gender Performance Variations

## Observations

-   The number of students who did well differs among schools.

-   School 70200001 has the most number of students scoring in the top 75 percentile range in Maths and Science. Similarly, School 70200115 has the most number of students scoring in the bottom 25 percentile range in both Maths and Science.

# **4. Conclusion**

Besides the observations/insights mentioned above after each plot, there are some notes for users:

-   Incomplete data: Some of the responses are not completed, for example there are about 236 students who did not answer their immigrant status.

-   Scatter plots are used to determine if there is any correlation between 2 variables. However, this does not mean causation. For example, we can see that if the home posession index (HOMEPOS) increases, the Maths score tends to be higher. But this does not mean that HOMEPOS causes the students to do better in Maths.
