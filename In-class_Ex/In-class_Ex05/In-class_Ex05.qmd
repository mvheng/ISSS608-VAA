# 1. Basic of Shiny

These are the 3 essential parts of building a Shiny app.

-   UI interface for us to control the layout, appearance, and type of controls of the app. (This is what users will click or choose)

-   Server function for us to build the output display in the forms of plot, text, table, image etc.

-   ShinyApp is to create to shiny app object.
