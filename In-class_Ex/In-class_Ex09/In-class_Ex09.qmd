**Bullet Graph**

**Sparkline Chart**

There is no ready-template for sparkline chart. However, we can use line chart and create a few calculated fields to make sparkline chart.

1st calculated field to determine the max and min point of the sales:

IF WINDOW_MAX(sum(\[Sales\])) = SUM(\[Sales\]) OR WINDOW_MIN(SUM(\[Sales\])) = SUM(\[Sales\])

THEN sum(\[Sales\]) END

2nd calculated field to state the point is max or min (so that we can assign different colours)

IF SUM(\[Sales\]) = WINDOW_MAX(SUM(\[Sales\])) THEN 'High'

ELSEIF SUM(\[Sales\]) = WINDOW_MIN(SUM(\[Sales\])) THEN 'Low' END

3rd calculated field to label the min and max sales

IF SUM(\[Sales\]) = WINDOW_MAX(SUM(\[Sales\])) OR SUM(\[Sales\]) = WINDOW_MIN(SUM(\[Sales\]))

THEN SUM(\[Sales\]) END
